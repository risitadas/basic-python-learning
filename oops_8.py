abstraction and encapsulation in python

'''
'''
What is Abstraction?
Abstraction refers to hiding unnecessary details to focus on the whole product
 instead of parts of the project separately. 
 It is a mechanism that represents the important features without including implementation details.
  Abstraction helps us in partitioning the program into many independent concepts so we may 
  hide the irrelevant information in the code. It offers the greatest flexibility when
   using abstract data-type objects in different situations.

What is Encapsulation?
Encapsulation means hiding under layers.
 When working with classes and handling sensitive data,
  global access to all the variables used in the program is not secure. 
  In Encapsulation, the internal representation of an object is generally hidden from the outside to secure the data. 
  It improves the maintainability of an application and helps the developers to organize the code better.
